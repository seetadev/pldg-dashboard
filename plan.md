I'll help you create a plan to integrate Cohort 2 data into the dashboard while maintaining access to Cohort 1 data. Here's a step-by-step implementation plan:

Implementation Steps

1. **Data Migration**
   - Move Cohort 1 data to `/data/cohort-1/`
   - Place Cohort 2 data in `/data/cohort-2/`
   - Update data loading utilities to handle cohort-specific paths

2. **Type Updates**
   - Add cohort-specific types and interfaces
   - Update existing types to include cohort information

3. **Processing Pipeline**
   - Modify data processing functions to handle both cohorts
   - Add cohort-specific processing logic if needed
   - Implement cohort data validation

4. **UI Updates**
   - Add CohortSelector component at the top of the dashboard
   - Update existing visualizations to reflect cohort context
   - Add loading states for cohort switching

5. **State Management**
   - Implement cohort selection logic
   - Add data caching for better performance
   - Handle cohort-specific error states

6. **Testing**
   - Add tests for cohort-specific data processing
   - Test cohort switching functionality
   - Verify data integrity across cohorts

### 6. Additional Considerations

1. **Performance**
   - Implement data caching for both cohorts
   - Consider lazy loading cohort data
   - Optimize state updates during cohort switches

2. **Error Handling**
   - Add specific error states for cohort loading
   - Implement fallback UI for missing cohort data
   - Add data validation for cohort-specific formats

3. **Analytics**
   - Track cohort switching behavior
   - Monitor performance metrics per cohort
   - Gather usage statistics for different cohorts

4. **Documentation**
   - Update README with cohort-specific information
   - Document data format differences between cohorts
   - Add migration guides for future cohorts

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to integrating Cohort 2 data while maintaining access to Cohort 1 data. The modular design allows for easy addition of future cohorts and maintains good performance through proper state management and data caching.
