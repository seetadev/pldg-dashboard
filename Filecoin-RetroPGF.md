## 🧭 Project Name  
**PLDG Dashboard**

## 🧩 Project Category  
Developer Tooling / Filecoin Education & Ecosystem Infrastructure

## 🧠 Project Description  
The **PLDG Dashboard** is a real-time analytics platform for tracking developer engagement, technical progress, and contribution metrics across the **Protocol Labs Developer Guild (PLDG)** program. It offers transparent, data-driven insights into the health and growth of the Filecoin and Libp2p ecosystems through integrations with **Storacha**, **Filecoin & IPFS**, **Py-libp2p** and **Builder Insights**.  

This voluntary initiative, developed by **C4GT (Code for GovTech)** contributors, fosters collaborative learning and ecosystem alignment. It enables participants to visualize their open-source impact and identify growth pathways within the **Filecoin**, **Libp2p**, **Fil-Oz**, **Fil-B**, and **Storacha** communities.  

## 🌍 Impact Summary  
Since **November 2024**, the PLDG Dashboard has enhanced transparency and engagement within the Filecoin developer ecosystem. By combining on-chain analytics, GitHub activity tracking, and AI summarization, it empowers contributors to reflect on their OSS journeys while providing ecosystem leads with actionable insights into developer engagement and community health.  

Over time, it aims to become a cornerstone of **impact metrics and self-reflection** across all Protocol Labs Network (PLN) developer programs — improving talent management, recognition, and collaboration across open-source teams.
